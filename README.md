👋 Hello, and welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

🚀 My name is Augusto Coutinho, and I’m a Tech Lead and Back-End Software Engineer with a strong academic background in Software Engineering from Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais (PUC Minas). I’m passionate about designing scalable, high-performance systems that solve real-world problems through clean architecture and resilient engineering.

🔧 I specialize in Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, and cloud-native development with Docker and Kubernetes. I have hands-on experience with microservices, event-driven architecture, and high-throughput APIs. My main focus is building reliable systems that support large-scale applications, including a Pix platform that processes over 2 million transactions daily and handles 500+ transactions per second.

🏗️ I’ve led backend teams through all phases of software development — from designing architecture and setting standards, to mentoring developers and optimizing CI/CD pipelines. I value engineering metrics, observability, and automation as essential tools for sustainable delivery.

👥 As a technical leader, I prioritize people. I run 1:1s, give structured feedback, and support career growth through Individual Development Plans (IDPs). I believe strong teams build strong systems, and I work every day to create a culture of trust, learning, and excellence.

📚 I'm also passionate about continuous learning and knowledge sharing. I actively contribute to documentation, mentor junior devs, and enjoy participating in coding challenges, meetups, and tech communities.

💼 Currently, I work as a Tech Lead at Okto, leading the backend team of the Payments Pix squad.

📬 Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my projects, open issues, or reach out if you'd like to collaborate, exchange ideas, or just chat about backend engineering, distributed systems, or career growth in tech.
